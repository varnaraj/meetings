Data Structure and Algorithm
@17th June 2021 3pm-5pm
=> C++ basically used in synopsys

DATA STRUCTURE ALGORITHM
Purpose =>To solve problems better than human

=> DS is an abstract concept.
=> Space and Time , CPU power are main things have to consider when solve problems.

DS
|-Primitive
	=> Integer,Float,Charector
|-Non Primitive
	|-Linear=> Array , Stack, Queue, LinkedList
	|-Non Linear=> Graphs, Trees
	|-Files

ARRAY
-Sequential container.
-Random Access
-Constant time
-linear space

heap -> dynamic memory (Allocate in runtime)
stack -> static memory (Allocate in compiletime)
